## DESCRIPTION

Students will explore changing the velocity of the Autopilot robot while creating projects that drive the robot forward, move it in reverse, and turn the robot.


## KEY CONCEPTS

- Changing velocity
- Robot Behaviors
- How to create, download and run a project
- Programming the velocity for driving forward and in reverse
- Programming the velocity for turningHow to save a project
- How to reason abstractly, quantitatively, and attend to precision


## Objectives

- Build an Autopilot robot and attach the Bumper Switch and the Smart Sensors.
- Program the Autopilot to change its velocity while driving forward, in reverse, and while turning.
- Evaluate student projects to improve and enhance them.


## Materials needed

- VEX IQ Super Kit
- VEXcode IQ Blocks
- Engineering Notebook


## STEM Lab Format

The following VEX STEM Lab supports students as they are introduced to completing a build of a robot, to recognizing robotic behaviors and settings that are used to determine its movements, and to using the VEXcode IQ Blocks drivetrain behaviors to complete basic robotic movements with their Autopilot robot. Students will explore how robot behaviors are used to keep passengers safe in vehicles and will consider how changing the velocity is important in the world of VEX Robotics competitions.

- Seek: The goal of this section is for students to work collaboratively to build the Autopilot and answer exploration questions in their engineering notebook.
  - The Completed Look of the Build
    - This page features a picture of a completely built Autopilot robot that can be used to introduce the STEM Lab. It serves as a student reference during the building process.
  - Parts Needed
    - This page lists all the parts needed to build the Autopilot. It serves to ensure that students have the proper materials to begin the building process.
  - Build Instructions
    - This section features detailed steps for students to follow to build the Autopilot. The Autopilot will be used for the duration of the STEM Lab. Suggested Time Allotment: 60 mins.
  - Exploration Questions
    - This page features several discussion questions to pique interest in the Autopilot and its capabilities. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.

- Play: The goal of this section is for students to demonstrate how the Autopilot operates and behaves when blocks used for setting velocity are included in a project.
  - Changing Velocity
    - This page explains that VEX IQ Smart Motors can be programmed to spin or drive at different velocities and why that is important. It also points out that their default velocity is 50%. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.
  - Exploration of Velocity
    - This page introduces students to VEXcode IQ Blocks and specifically the blocks used to set velocity. Suggested Time Allotment: 40 mins.

- Apply: The goal of this section is to introduce students to some everyday applications of programming a robot’s velocity and the value of being able to set your robot’s velocity for automated performances during a VEX IQ Robotics competition.  
  - The Velocity of Vehicles
    - This page explores a few examples of how robots you may encounter daily such as cars or elevators change velocity for safety or performance. Suggested Time Allotment: 10 mins.
  - Changing the Velocity of Competition Robots
    - This page explains the benefit of an automated robot changing velocity while engaged in a VEX Robotics competition. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins. This page is optional.

- Rethink: The goal of this section is for students to explore ways to use VEXcode IQ Blocks to change the velocity of additional forward, reverse and turning movements using the Autopilot robot.
  - Improve Your Project
    - This page prepares the students to engage in the Remix activities on the next page by checking to make sure they have all the Hardware/Software required and their Autopilot robot is ready. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins. This page is optional.
  - Remix Your Project
    - This page offers guiding questions for students to answer as they continue to explore and utilize programming blocks.  Students will work together to revise and test their projects for moving using varying velocities. Suggested Time Allotment: 25 mins. This page is optional.

- Know: The goal of this section is for students to complete a summative assessment on the content presented in the STEM lab.
  - Know Questions
    - Students will answer several multiple-choice assessment questions. Students receive immediate feedback as their answer choices are submitted. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.


##  Facilitation Notes

- Teacher support, discussion questions, tips, and student assessment are all organized in the STEM Lab to give the teacher a successful engagement.
- VEXcode IQ Blocks and the VEXos Utility should be downloaded to each student device that will be used for programming the Autopilot.
- Students should become familiar with the pieces before beginning to build the Autopilot.  Each Superkit contains a poster containing true size representations of all the pieces contained in the kit.
- Batteries should be charged prior to the start of the STEM lab.
- An engineering notebook can be as simple as lined paper within a folder or binder. The notebook shown is a more sophisticated example that is available through VEX.
