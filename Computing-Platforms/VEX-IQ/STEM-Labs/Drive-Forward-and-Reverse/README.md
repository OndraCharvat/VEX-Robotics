## DESCRIPTION

Students will explore robot behaviors and create code to drive the Autopilot robot forward and in reverse.


## KEY CONCEPTS

- Robot Behaviors
- How to create, download and run a project
- Programming forward movement
- Programming backwards movement
- How to save a project


## Objectives

- Build an Autopilot robot and configure the Smart sensors.
- Identify programming behaviors.
- Program the Autopilot to drive forward and in reverse.
- Explore drivetrain programming blocks and test student created programs.


## Materials Needed

- VEX IQ Super Kit
- VEXcode IQ Blocks
- Engineering Notebook


## STEM Lab Format

The following VEX STEM Lab supports students as they are introduced to completing a build of a robot, recognizing robotic behaviors are used to determine its movements, and using the VEXcode IQ Blocks drivetrain behaviors to complete basic robotic movements with their Autopilot robot. Students will explore how robot behaviors are used in various industries and will be introduced to the exciting world of VEX competitions.


Seek: The goal of this section is for students to work collaboratively to build the Autopilot and answer exploration questions in their engineering notebook.

- The Completed Look of the Build
  - This page features a picture of a completely built the Autopilot robot that can be used to introduce the STEM Lab. It can be used as a student reference during the building process.

- Parts Needed
  - This page lists all the parts needed to build the Autopilot. It can be used as a student reference during the building process.

- Build Instructions
  - This section features detailed steps for students to follow to build the Autopilot. The Autopilot will be used for the duration of the STEM Lab. Suggested Time Allotment: 60 mins.

- Exploration Questions
  - This page features several discussion questions to pique interest in the Autopilot and its capabilities. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.


Play: The goal of this section is for students to demonstrate how the Autopilot operates and behaves when basic drivetrain commands are used in a program.

- Robot Behaviors
  - This page introduced features information on the three types of robot behaviors and how they work to command the robot to complete a variety of tasks. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.

- Forward and Reverse Exploration
  - This page introduced students to VEXcode IQ Blocks and specifically the drivetrain commands. Suggested Time Allotment: 40 mins.


Apply: The goal of this section is to introduce students to some of the uses of Robotics in different industries and to the VEX IQ Robotics competition.

- Robotic Movements
  - This page explores how robot behaviors are applied in several different industries. Suggested Time Allotment: 10 mins.

- Letâ€™s Compete!
  - This page contains introduces the students to VEX competitions, which give students a chance to complete using their original robotic build to solve a gaming challenge. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins. This page is optional.


Rethink: The goal of this section is for students to explore ways to use VEXcode IQ Blocks to complete additional forward and reverse movements using the Autopilot.

- Improve and Remix Your Project
  - This page offers guiding questions for students to answer as they continue to explore and utilize programming blocks. Students will work together to write code and test their programs to move specific distances. Suggested Time Allotment: 30 mins. This page is optional.


Know: The goal of this section is for students to complete a summative assessment on the content presented in the STEM lab.

- Know Questions
  - Students will answer several multiple-choice assessment questions. Students receive immediate feedback as their answer choices are submitted. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.


## Facilitation Notes

- Teacher support, discussion questions, tips, and student assessment are all organized in the STEM lab to give the teacher a successful engagement.
- VEXcode IQ Blocks and the VEXos Utility should be downloaded to each student device that will be used for programming the Autopilot.
- Students should become familiar with the pieces before beginning to build the Autopilot. Each Superkit contains a poster containing true size representations of all the pieces contained in the kit.
- Batteries should be charged prior to the start of the STEM lab.
- An engineering notebook can be as simple as lined paper within a folder or binder. The notebook shown is a more sophisticated example that is available through VEX.
