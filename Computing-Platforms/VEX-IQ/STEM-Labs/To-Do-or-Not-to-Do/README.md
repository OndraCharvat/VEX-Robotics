## DESCRIPTION

Students are asked to program their robot to act on conditionals and create a User Interface (UI).


## KEY CONCEPTS

- Programing Conditionals
- Robot Behaviors
- Analytical Thinking


## Objectives

- Apply building directions in a multistep procedure to assemble the VEX IQ Clawbot to complete a specific task.
- Identify the benefits of using conditional programming structures within a project.
- Identify how if-then and if-then-else blocks affect program flow.
- Identify types of User Interfaces (UIs).
- Explain the boolean condition of each branch of the if-then-else block.
- Apply pseudocode to the design of their project to sort out an algorithm for programming the interface.
- Apply conditional programming to create a solution to the challenge of letting users control the Clawbot with a three-button interface (up arrow, down arrow, and check) in order to pick up items from a table.


## Materials needed

- 1 or more VEX IQ Super Kits
- Aluminum can, empty water bottle, and other durable objects for lifting
- Engineering notebook
- A stopwatch or any device that can track a minute of time


## Facilitation Notes

- Ensure all required parts for the build are available prior to starting this STEM Lab.
- Make sure that there is ample space in the classroom to measure out and tape the layout for the User Interface Challenge.
- Make sure that your robot is configured properly. If your robot is configured differently, you can make adjustments in the Robot Config view of VEXcode IQ Blocks.
- If multiple students will be downloading their saved project to the same robot, have the students add their initials to the name of the saved project (For example, "Forward and Backward_MW"). This way students can find and make adjustments to their projects and not others.
- An engineering notebook can be as simple as lined paper within a folder or binder. The notebook shown is a more sophisticated example that is available through VEX Robotics.
- Students can share their pseudocode with the teacher for feedback prior to creating the project for feedback.
- The approximate pacing of each section of the Stem Lab is as follows: Seek- 65 minutes, Play- 45 minutes, Apply- 15 minutes, Rethink- 65 minutes, Know- 5 minutes.


## Further Your Learning

Science & Technology
- Many physical (button-driven) User Interfaces (UIs) have been replaced by Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Have students investigate commonly used devices (keypads, phones, calculators, computers) that have transitioned from button-driven UIs to icon-driven GUIs. What are the benefits/costs?
