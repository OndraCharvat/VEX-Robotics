## DESCRIPTION

Learn how to program loops to get your robot grooving!


## KEY CONCEPTS

- Programming Loops
- Robot Behaviors
- Analytical Thinking


## Objectives

- Analyze building directions and create a robot to complete a specific task.
- Analyze directions to configure and program a robot to complete a series of tasks.
- Explain and use loops to create a project with repeated movements.
- Create a project that follows specific student created pseudocode that will direct their robot to dance.


## Materials needed

- 1 or more VEX IQ Super Kits
- Meter stick
- Engineering notebook
- VEXcode IQ Blocks


## STEM Lab Format

The following VEX STEM Lab supports students as they are introduced to completing a build of a robot, recognizing repeating actions that can be represented using loops, and using the VEXcode IQ Blocks to complete basic robotic movements with their Clawbot robot. Students will explore how repeating behaviors are used in various industries and will be introduced to the exciting world of VEX competitions.

- Seek: The goal of this section is for students to work collaboratively to build the Clawbot IQ and answer exploration questions in their engineering notebook.
  - The Completed Look of the Build
    - This page features a picture of a completely built the Clawbot robot that can be used to introduce the STEM Lab. It can be used as a student reference during the building process.
  - Parts Needed
    - This page lists all the parts needed to build the Clawbot. It can be used as a student reference during the building process.
  - Build Instructions
    - This section features detailed steps for students to follow to build the Clawbot. The Clawbot will be used for the duration of the STEM Lab. Suggested Time Allotment: 60 mins.
  - Exploration Questions
    - This page features several discussion questions to pique interest in the Clawbot and its capabilities. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.

- Play: The goal of this section is for students to demonstrate how the Clawbot operates and behaves when basic drivetrain commands are used in a project.
  - Robot Repetition
    - This page introduces how robots can use loops to repeat actions. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.
  - Programming Loops in VEXcode IQ Blocks
    - This page introduces students to VEXcode IQ Blocks and specifically the forever and repeat loop blocks. Suggested Time Allotment: 40 mins.

- Apply: The goal of this section is to introduce students to some of the uses of Robotics in different industries and to the VEX IQ Robotics competition.
  - Robots in Manufacturing
    - This page explores how robot behaviors are applied in several different industries. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.
  - Controllers and Loops
    - This page introduces the students to VEX competitions, which give students a chance to complete using their original robotic build to solve a gaming challenge. Suggested Time Allotment: 10 mins. This page is optional.

- Rethink: The goal of this section is for students to explore ways to use VEXcode IQ Blocks to complete additional forward and reverse movements using the Clawbot.
  - Prepare for the Groove Machine Challenge
    - This page displays the layout and brief explanation for the challenge that will follow. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins. This page is optional.
  - Design, Develop, and Iterate on your Project
    - This page allows students to plan how they will organize their project for the challenge. It also provides students with steps on how to get started with their project. Suggested Time Allotment: 30 mins. This page is optional.
  - The Groove Machine Challenge
    - This page asks students to program their robot to perform a dance routine! The students will need to follow specific rules and criteria to meet the challenge. Suggested Time Allotment: 30 mins. This page is optional.

- Know: The goal of this section is for students to complete a summative assessment on the content presented in the STEM lab.
  - Know Questions
    - Students will answer several multiple-choice assessment questions. Students receive immediate feedback as their answer choices are submitted. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.


## Facilitation Notes

- Ensure all required parts for the build are available prior to starting this STEM Lab.
- Make sure that there is ample space in the classroom to measure out and tape the layout of the "dance floor" that will be used in the activity.
- If multiple students will be downloading their saved projects to the same robot, have the students add their initials to the name of the saved project (For example, "Forward and Backward_MW). This way students can find and make adjustments to their projects and not others.
- An engineering notebook can be as simple as lined paper within a folder or binder. The notebook shown is a more sophisticated example that is available through VEX Robotics.
- The approximate pacing of each section of the Stem Lab is as follows: Seek- 65 minutes, Play- 45 minutes, Apply- 15 minutes, Rethink- 65 minutes, Know- 5 minutes.


## Further Your Learning

Health
- Have students write about the benefits of dance and other low-impact exercise.

Science
- When finding a good source of pollen, honeybees complete a "waggle dance" to communicate the directions to the other bees of the hive. Have the students conduct research on this subject and see where else "dance" is used in nature for communication purposes.
