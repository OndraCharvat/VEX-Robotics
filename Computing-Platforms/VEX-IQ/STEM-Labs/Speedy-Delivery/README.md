## DESCRIPTION
Students are asked to program a robot to navigate a warehouse and to prepare packages for delivery.


## KEY CONCEPTS

- Programing
- Robot Behaviors
- Iterative Design


## Objectives

- Apply building instructions to create a robot to complete a specific task.
- Identify the applications of the spin for and spin to position blocks.
- Identify the sequence needed to capture and transport an object to a specific location.
- Explain the appropriate use case for the set timeout block.
- Use the Device Info on the VEX IQ Brain to understand the arm's and claw's ranges of motion.
- Create a plan for sequencing the project's programming utilizing pseudocode.


## Materials needed

- 1 or more VEX IQ Super Kit
- Roll of tape
- Scissors
- Meter stick or ruler
- Engineering notebook
- Aluminum cans or empty water bottles
- A stopwatch or any device that can track a minute of time
- 4 x 8 feet or 1.22 x 2.44 m open area
- Optional: VEX IQ Challenge Field
- VEXcode IQ Blocks
- IQ Clawbot Template


## What You'll Need to Know

Programming Driving Forward and in Reverse
- See Driving Forward and Backward Tutorial in VEXcode IQ Blocks as needed.

Programming Turning Right and Turning Left
- See Turning Tutorial in VEXcode IQ Blocks as needed.


## Facilitation Notes

- Ensure all required parts for the build are available prior to starting this STEM Lab.
- Make sure that there is ample space in the classroom to measure and tape the layout of the "warehouse" that will be used in the activity. If you have a VEX IQ Challenge Field, the dimensions for the activity are the same as the field.
- If multiple students will be downloading their saved projects to the same robot, have the students add their initials to the name of the saved project (For example, "Forward and Backward_MW). This way students can find and make adjustments to their projects and not others.
- An engineering notebook can be as simple as lined paper within a folder or binder. The notebook shown is a more sophisticated example that is available through VEX Robotics.
- Students can share their pseudocode with the teacher for feedback prior to creating the project for feedback.
- Students can create and expand on the warehouse floor plan to explore different programming options.
- The approximate pacing of each section of the Stem Lab is as follows: Seek- 65 minutes, Play- 45 minutes, Apply- 10 minutes, Rethink- 105 minutes, Know- 5 minutes.


## Further Your Learning

English/Debate
- Discuss the pros and cons of robots completing more industrial and professional tasks as technology develops.
- Research and write about other areas where robotic precision is being developed or should be explored.

History
- Write a paragraph or create a timeline sharing the highlights of industrial robotic development from 1954 until present day.
