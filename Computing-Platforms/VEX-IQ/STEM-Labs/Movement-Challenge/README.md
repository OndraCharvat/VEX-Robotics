## DESCRIPTION

Students will program their Autopilot to drive on a designated path through a sequence of movements.


## KEY CONCEPTS

- Robot Behaviors
- Decompose the steps needed to solve a challenge
- Spatial Reasoning
- How to create, download and run a project
- Programming a sequence of movements
- How to save a project


## Objectives

- Build an Autopilot robot and configure the Smart sensors
- Decompose problems into smaller subproblems to facilitate the program development process
- Program the Autopilot to follow a specific path
- Compare and refine algorithms for the same task and determine which is the most appropriate
- Use operator blocks to make the robot move a precise distance
- Test and debug a program to make sure it runs accurately
- Describe choices made during program development using comments and presentations


## Materials needed

- Autopilot Robot
- Charged Robot Battery  
- VEXcode IQ Blocks
- USB Cable (if using a computer)
- Engineering Notebook/ Graph Paper
- Larger Paper
- Rulers
- Markers
- Blocks (2-3 per group)


## STEM Lab Format

The following VEX STEM Lab supports students as they use their programming skills to create a sequence of movements that will solve a challenge centered around completing a specific path created by a collaborative team. Students are introduced to completing a build of a robot,learning about code specificity, creating comments in a program using VEXcode IQ Blocks. Students will explore how robot behaviors are used to help communities and will be introduced to the annual VEX competition challenge.

- Seek: The goal of this section is for students to work collaboratively to build the Autopilot and answer exploration questions in their engineering notebook.
  - The Completed Look of the Build
    - This page features a picture of a completely built Autopilot robot that can be used to introduce the STEM Lab. It can be used as a student reference during the building process.
  - Parts Needed
    - This page lists all the parts needed to build the Autopilot. It can be used as a student reference during the building process.
  - Build Instructions
    - This section features detailed steps for students to follow to build the Autopilot. The Autopilot will be used for the duration of the STEM Lab. Suggested Time Allotment: 60 mins.
  - Exploration Questions
    - This page features several discussion questions to pique interest in the Autopilot and its capabilities. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.

- Play: The goal of this section is for students to create a programming  solution to an open ended challenge using the Autopilot and VEXcode Blocks for IQ.
  - Recycle Robot Run
    - This page focuses on the specificity needed in translating an idea into action for a robot, and how robot actions differ from human actions. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.
  - Open Ended STEM Lab Exploration
    - This page asks students to create a project for a scenario where a robot is used to help with a job in a school: collecting the recycling from classrooms at the end of the day. Suggested Time Allotment: 40 mins.

- Apply:  The goal of this section is to introduce students to how robots are used in the real world to accomplish tasks that are too dangerous for humans. Also, students are introduced to how to start a VEX Robotics team.
  - Italy’s Trash Robot
    - This page discusses how communities use robots to solve problems. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.
  - Competition with a Purpose
    - This page contains information on VEX competitions and how they use purposeful movement in their annual challenges. Suggested Time Allotment: 10 mins.

- Rethink: The goal of this section is for students to explore ways to use VEXcode IQ Blocks to complete additional turning movements using the Autopilot.
  - Improve Your Project
    - This page offers guiding questions for students to answer as they continue to explore coding sequences and spatial reasoning. Students will work together to write and test their programs to move their Autopilot through a specific path. Suggested Time Allotment: 50 mins. This page is optional.

- Know: The goal of this section is for students to complete a summative assessment on the content presented in the STEM lab.
  - Know Questions
    - Students will answer several multiple-choice assessment questions. Students receive immediate feedback as their answer choices are submitted. Suggested Time Allotment: 5 mins.


## Facilitation Notes

- Teacher support, discussion questions, tips, and student assessment are all organized in the STEM lab to give the teacher a successful engagement.
- VEXcode IQ Blocks and VEXos Utility should be downloaded to each student device that will be used for programming the Autopilot.
- Students should become familiar with the pieces before beginning to build the Autopilot. Each Superkit contains a poster containing true size representations of all the pieces contained in the kit.
- Batteries should be charged prior to the start of the STEM lab.
- An engineering notebook can be as simple as lined paper within a folder or binder. The notebook shown is a more sophisticated example that is available through VEX.
