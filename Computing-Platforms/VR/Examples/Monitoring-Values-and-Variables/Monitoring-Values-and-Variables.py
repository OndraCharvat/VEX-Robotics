# 	Project:        Monitoring Values and Variables  
#	Description:    This example monitors variables and sensors
#                   to display their values in the Monitor Console
#   Configuration:  VR Robot
# 
# --------------------------------------------------

# Library imports
from vexcode import *

# Global variable must be defined outside of the main() function
my_variable = 0

# Add project code in "main"
def main():
    # To have a variable appear in the monitor tab,
    # it must be declared as a "global" variable and 
    # included inside the monitor_variable() command inside of quotation marks
    global my_variable
    monitor_variable("my_variable")

    # Use the monitor tab to check the values of the robot's sensors

    # Customize which sensor values you want displayed using the monitor_sensor() command. 
    # A full list of supported sensor names can be found in the help
    # document for the monitor_sensor command.
    monitor_sensor("drivetrain.is_done")

    # If you want to monitor multiple sensors, separate them using a comma
    monitor_sensor("drivetrain.is_moving",
                   "drivetrain.heading",
                   "location.position")

    # This while loop will continue until my_variable reaches 5
    # Observe how my_variable changes from 0 to 5 in the monitor tab
    # The robot will turn right 5 times
    while my_variable != 5:
        drivetrain.turn_for(RIGHT, 45, DEGREES)

        my_variable += 1

        brain.print(my_variable)
        brain.new_line()

        wait(1, SECONDS)

    wait(3, SECONDS)

    brain.clear()

    drivetrain.turn_to_heading(0, DEGREES)
